      <!-- intro -------------------------------------------------------------->

      <p>
        Consider a fairly simple imperative language, which consists of
        <em>declarations</em> and <em>statements</em>. Declarations declare and
        define items, like constants, functions and types, and statements change
        the runtime program state in some way. Declarations may refer to each
        other and themselves in any arbitrary order, while statements are
        executed sequentially and may only refer to items created
        &ldquo;before&rdquo; themselves.
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>fun</h-k> main
  <h-k>for</h-k> i <h-k>in</h-k> <h-l>0</h-l> <h-k>upto</h-k> <h-l>100</h-l> <h-k>when</h-k> odd?(i)
    <h-k>do</h-k> println(i)
  <h-k>end</h-k>
<h-k>end</h-k>

<h-k>fun</h-k> odd?(x: <h-t>Int</h-t>) =&gt;
  x <h-k>mod</h-k> <h-l>2</h-l> = <h-l>1</h-l>
</pre>

      <p>
        Because of this setup, name resolution must probably be a two-pass
        thing, where the compiler first finds all the names of declared items
        and only then resolves the names. 
      </p>

      <p>
        For a batch compiler, that's straightforward enough, but for a
        query-based compiler, like you might find in a language server, things
        are a bit more complicated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ideally, we want a query-based pass to be a pure-ish, idempotent
        operation such that we can easily cache them and only rerun the parts
        that have changed. Additionally, we probably <em>don't</em> want to run
        the declaration pass over every single file simultaneously, in order to
        be able to cache at a more granular level.
      </p>

      <p>
        This brings us to an important first clue. When we are just
        declaring the items in a given file, we
        <em>
          do not need to know what is going on in other files
        </em>.<sup><a href="#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a></sup>
        The big win here is that name declaration can happen file-by-file. This
        seems to imply that (part of) the declaration pass should look like
        this:
      </p>

      <pre>
decls_in_file: <h-t>List</h-t>(<h-t>Ast</h-t>) -&gt; <h-t>List</h-t>(<h-t>Name</h-t>)
</pre>

      <p>
        with the AST list containing all of the trees in a given file. This
        function can be a dead simple recursive pattern match, and is easily
        pure and idempotent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note also that this function also doesn't need to care about statements
        and the names declared within those. Because of their sequential and
        progressively scoped nature, names declared in a statement block are
        very naturally handled by the resolution pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        This isn't the whole story, however. If our language was a simple
        statements-within-declarations kind of language, then the list of names
        is a perfectly fine thing for the <code>decls_in_file</code> function to
        return (since there's only the top-level declaration block). If we want
        to support inline modules or declarative sections within a statement
        block, however, then things will get a bit more hairy. 
      </p>

      <p>Consider:</code>

      <pre>
<h-k>fun</h-k> main
  <h-k>let</h-k> x = hidden()
  <h-k>do</h-k> println(x)
<h-k>where</h-k> 
  <h-k>fun</h-k> hidden: <h-t>Int</h-t>
    <h-k>let</h-k> b, c = <h-l>2</h-l>, <h-l>3</h-l>
    <h-k>then</h-k>
      <h-k>return</h-k> d
    <h-k>where</h-k>
      <h-k>let</h-k> d = a + b + c
    <h-k>end</h-k>
  <h-k>end</h-k>

  <h-k>let</h-k> a = <h-l>4</h-l>
<h-k>end</h-k>
</pre>

      <p>
        Here, we have a declaration (of <code>main</code>), which contains some
        statements (the <code>let</code> and <code>do</code>), but also another
        declarative section (introduced by the <code>where</code> keyword).
        Inside that section, two more items are declared (<code>hidden</code>
        and <code>a</code>). The function itself contains some statements, one
        of which is a block statement that contains a declarative section, and
        that declarative section is allowed to reference items created by
        statements preceeding this one.
      </p>

      <p>
        This example is needlessly convoluted, but the ability to declare
        function local types and items can be quite a useful method of
        encapsulation, as something slightly more lightweight than a private
        module, for example.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless, the big takeaway is that even within a file, the declared
        items should form something closer to a tree than a list. For the
        example above, we may want to end up with something like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
(<h-l>file</h-l>)
<h-c>└─</h-c> main
<h-c>   ├─</h-c> a
<h-c>   ├─</h-c> hidden
<h-c>   │  └─</h-c> (<h-l>statements</h-l>)
<h-c>   │    ├─</h-c> b
<h-c>   │    ├─</h-c> c
<h-c>   │    └─</h-c> (<h-l>then</h-l>)
<h-c>   │       ├─</h-c> d
<h-c>   │       └─</h-c> (<h-l>statements</h-l>)
<h-c>   └─</h-c> (<h-l>statements</h-l>)
<h-c>      └─</h-c> x
</pre>


      <h2>Resolving</h2>

      <p>
        With that information, we should be able to resolve names. This pass
        may no longer be file local, since we might be importing items from
        other modules in other files. However, that is fine &ndash; we can just
        issue a query that runs the declaration pass on the appropirate file(s)
        whenever we hit an import. That way, we can ensure that the resolver
        pass doesn't need any more non-file-local information than absolutely
        necessary, which keeps the caching granular and nice.
      </p>

      <p>
        But how exactly do we approach the resolution? When we are recursing
        through the syntax trees, how do we keep track of where in the
        declaration tree we are? This gets especially tricky with declaration
        blocks, like in the example, where the actual declarative section is
        without a name and within some statement.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can employ another key observation here: we very rarely care about
        looking <em>inside</em> a scope, but we very often do care about looking
        <em>outside</em> one. Pretty much only in the case of modules do we even
        care about going inside of a scope to find more names, and it's pretty
        much always explicit when we're doing that (because of imports or
        <code>Module.name</code> syntax). 
      </p>

      <p>
        This seems to suggest that the important information is not which scopes
        a scope contains, but which scope is the parent of some other scope.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We still need some way of figuring out which scope we are in while
        traversing a syntax tree, but that can be achieved by assosciating each
        scope with a unique id and each scope-opening construct (block,
        declaration, etc) with the id of its scope.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that each declaring construct (<code>fun</code>, <code>let</code>,
        etc.) has been assosciated with the id of the scope it introduces. Each
        scope also contains a list of the names declared in that scope in the
        form it appears in the source. Ultimately, we end up with an AST type
        that looks something like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>enum</h-k> <h-t>Decl</h-t> {
    <h-l>Fun</h-l>(<h-t>ScopeId</h-t>, <h-t>Name</h-t>, <h-t>Vec</h-t>&lt;<h-t>Decl</h-t>&gt;, <h-t>Stmts</h-t>),
    <h-l>Let</h-l>(<h-t>ScopeId</h-t>, <h-t>Name</h-t>, <h-t>Expr</h-t>),
    <h-c>// ...</h-c>
}

<h-k>struct</h-k> <h-t>Stmts</h-t> {
    scope: <h-t>ScopeId</h-t>,
    stmts: <h-t>Vec</h-t>&lt;<h-t>Stmt</h-t>&gt;,
}

<h-k>enum</h-k> <h-t>Stmt</h-t> {
    <h-l>Do</h-l>(<h-t>Expr</h-t>),
    <h-l>Let</h-l>(<h-t>ScopeId</h-t>, <h-t>Name</h-t>, <h-t>Expr</h-t>),
    <h-l>Then</h-l>(<h-t>ScopeId</h-t>, <h-t>Vec</h-t>&lt;<h-t>Decl</h-t>&gt;, <h-t>Stmts</h-t>),
    <h-c>// ...</h-c>
}

<h-c>// ...</h-c>
</pre>

      <p>
        And a file scope type that looks like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>enum</h-k> <h-t>ScopeName</h-t> {
    <h-l>File</h-l>,
    <h-l>StatementList</h-l>,
    <h-l>Block</h-l>,
    <h-l>Name</h-l>(<h-t>Name</h-t>),
}

<h-k>struct</h-k> <h-t>Scope</h-t> {
    name: <h-t>ScopeName</h-t>,
    parent: <h-t>Option</h-t>&lt;<h-t>ScopeId</h-t>&gt;,
    children: <h-t>Vec</h-t>&lt;(<h-t>String</h-t>, <h-t>name</h-t>)&gt;,
}

<h-k>struct</h-k> <h-t>Scopes</h-t> {
    scopes: <h-t>HashMap</h-t>&lt;<h-t>ScopeId</h-t>, <h-t>Scope</h-t>&gt;,
}
</pre>

      <p>
        Resolving a name just involves keeping track of the nearest scope id,
        and consulting the appropriate <code>Scopes</code>.
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>impl</h-k> <h-t>Scopes</h-t> {
    <h-k>fn</h-k> find_name(&amp;<h-k>self</h-k>, at: <h-t>ScopeId</h-t>, name: &amp;<h-t>str</h-t>) -&gt; <h-t>Option</h-t>&lt;<h-t>Name</h-t>&gt; {
        <h-k>let</h-k> scope = <h-k>self</h-k>.scopes.get(id).unwrap();

        <h-c>// search this scope</h-c>
        <h-k>for</h-k> (other, res) <h-k>in</h-k> scope.children.iter() {
            <h-k>if</h-k> other == name {
                <h-k>return</h-k> <h-l>Some</h-l>(res);
            }
        }

        <h-c>// if not found, search the parent scope</h-c>
        scope.parent
            .map(|at| <h-k>self</h-k>.find_name(at, name)
    }
}
</pre>

      <p>
        There's some extra care needed to handle statements and statement scopes
        properly, but that's the general idea.
      </p>
