      <!-- intro -------------------------------------------------------------->

      <p>
        In OOP, subtyping generally goes hand-in-hand with inheritance. If some
        class <code>Cat</code> inherits from another class <code>Fluffy</code>,
        then the former is a subtype of the latter. This follows from the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">
          Liskov substitution principle
        </a>
        which defines subtypey-ness in terms of substitutability. Since
        inheritance implies, well, inheritance, then any method you can call on
        <code>Fluffy</code> you can also call on <code>Cat</code> without issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        This could be seen as a specific case of a more general principle of
        <em>record subtyping</em>: if a have a record <code>R</code>, then any
        record which has <em>at least all</em> of <code>R</code>'s fields is a
        subtype. For instance, if I have some type 
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>Pet</h-t> = {
  name : <h-t>String</h-t>,
  age  : <h-t>Nat</h-t>,
}
</pre>

      <p>
        then the only thing I can do with a value of that type is access its
        name or access its age. As such, a type like 
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>Cat</h-t> = {
  name       : <h-t>String</h-t>,
  age        : <h-t>Nat</h-t>,
  fluffiness : <h-t>Float</h-t>,
}
</pre>

      <p>
        can also be used as a <code>Pet</code> since accessing its name or its
        age are valid operations on this type too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inheritance is a different concept, and has to do with one type copying
        properties from another. In the <code>Cat</code>/<code>Pet</code>
        example, we could let <code>Cat</code> inherit some fields from
        <code>Pet</code> to minimize duplication: 
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>Cat</h-t> = {
  fluffiness : <h-t>Float</h-t>,
  <h-k>with</h-k> <h-t>Pet</h-t>
}
</pre>

      <p>
        For records and classes, this kind of inheritance does seem to imply
        subtyping &ndash; since inheriting guarantees we have at least all of
        the fields of the parent class.
      </p>

      <p>
        This doesn't have to be the case. Consider an <code>enum</code> like
        this:
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>Bool</h-t> =
  true,
  false,
</pre>

      <p>
        What would it mean for some other type to be a subtype of this?
        Following the principle of substitutability, some type
        <code>HappyBool</code> is a subtype of <code>Bool</code> if we can give
        a <code>HappyBool</code> to anything expecting a <code>Bool</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A simple example of something expecting a <code>Bool</code> is an
        exhaustive pattern match:
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>fun</h-k> to_string(self: <h-t>Bool</h-t>): <h-t>String</h-t>
  <h-k>return case</h-k> self
    <h-k>is</h-k> true  =&gt; <h-l>"happy"</h-l>
    <h-k>is</h-k> false =&gt; <h-l>"sad"</h-l>
  <h-k>end</h-k>
<h-k>end</h-k>
</pre>

      <p>
        If <code>HappyBool</code> is to be a subtype of <code>Bool</code>, then
        <code>to_string</code> must work for all values of
        <code>HappyBool</code>, which means it must return some string, which
        means the current branches in the <code>case</code> expression must be
        exhaustive &ndash; all of which means that <code>HappyBool</code> must
        have <em>at most</em> all of <code>Bool</code>'s variants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, <code>HappyBool</code> is a subtype:
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>HappyBool</h-t> =
  true,
</pre>
      
      <p>
        while <code>ProperBool</code> is in fact a supertype:
      </p>
      <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>ProperBool</h-t> =
  true,
  false,
  file_not_found,
</pre>

      <p>
        This has the fun consequence that sum types actually flip the subtyping
        relationship when inheriting:
      </p>

      <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>ProperBool</h-t> =
  file_not_found,
  <h-k>with</h-k> <h-t>Bool</h-t>
</pre>

      <p>
        In general, inheriting from a product-like type makes you the subtype,
        while inheriting from a sum-like type makes it the subtype.
      </p>

      <p>
        All in all, subtyping and inheritance are two orthogonal concepts, but
        which are easy to confuse since the latter concept is most common in
        object-oriented languages where only product-like subtyping is
        available. There are some languages which feature sum-like subtyping and
        inheritance (like the in-development
        <a href="https://github.com/ALANVF/Star-lang-specification/blob/master/design/kinds.md#inheritance">
          Star</a>) and some which feature an explicit distinction between
        inheritance and subtyping (like in Ada where types may
        <a href="http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rm12_w_tc1/html/RM-3-4.html">
          derive</a> or be a
        <a href="http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rm12_w_tc1/html/RM-3-2-2.html">
          subtype</a>) .
      </p>

        <p>
          This article focuses only on structural subtyping, since I think that
          that is a cleaner way of demonstrating the substitution principle.
          Still, the story for nominal subtyping is largely the same, expect
          with some more explicit declarations of subtype-y ness.
