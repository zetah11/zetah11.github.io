      <p>
        A
        <a href="https://thephd.dev/lambdas-nested-functions-block-expressions-oh-my">
           &ldquo;recent&rdquo; article
        </a>
        about the struggle to get nested functions and lambdas into C. This got
        me curious as to how it is implemented in Ada, where nested functions
        can be called like any other as well as passed to functions expecting
        function pointers. Specifically, we'll see how GNAT does it for x86-64.
      </p>

      <p>
        The TL;DR is that nested functions are implemented as a kind of closure,
        where the function itself expects a pointer to the stack frame in the
        <code>r10</code> register. If we need to go multiple scopes out, then
        the outer frame pointer is expected to be at the bottom of the frame,
        effectively creating a linked list of frames we can traverse. To let
        nested functions be passed as function pointers, we create a structure
        on the stack containing the actual function pointer and the necessary
        frame pointer, create a pointer to that structure, set its lowest bit,
        and send that pointer as the function pointer. Any call to a function
        pointer now needs to check if the lowest bit is set, and if so,
        dereference to find the frame pointer, put that in <code>r10</code>,
        then call the actual function pointer. 
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="stacky-closures">Stacky closures</h2>

        <p>
          The first example we will look at is rather simple:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>function</h-k> Id (Num : <h-t>Integer</h-t>) <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k>
  <h-k>function</h-k> Inner <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k> (Num);
<h-k>begin</h-k>
  <h-k>return</h-k> Inner;
<h-k>end</h-k> Id;
</pre>

        <p>
          <em>
            Note that the <code>Inner</code> is implicitly a function call,
            unlike in C. If we wanted the address of the function, we'd write
            <code>Inner'Access</code>.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's look at the generated assembly for the above function. The code
          for <code>Inner</code> looks something
          like<sup><a href="#note-1" id="ref-1a">1</a></sup>:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-t>id__inner</h-t>:
        <h-k>push</h-k>    rbp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rbp, rsp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>8</h-l>], r10    <h-c># save the frame</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     eax, [r10]      <h-c># return frame-&gt;Num</h-c>
        <h-k>pop</h-k>     rbp
        <h-k>ret</h-k>     
</pre>

        <p>
          The calling convention expects the return value as a 32-bit integer in
          the <code>eax</code> register, so the important line is the
          <code>mov eax, [r10]</code>. Nested functions expect what we might
          call a <em>frame pointer</em> in <code>r10</code>, which points to
          some place in the stack frame. Further, <code>Id.Inner</code> expects
          the <code>X</code> variable to be the first value stored at that frame
          pointer. The stack should therefore look something like this when
          we're executing <code>Inner</code>:
        </p>

        <pre>
,---------------------,
| (Inner stack frame) |
|---------------------|
| ...                 |
| ...                 |
| ...                 |
|---------------------| &lt;-- end of Id stack frame
| Num                 |
|---------------------| &lt;-- r10 (the frame pointer)
| ...                 |
</pre>

        <p>
          If we had more stack-allocated variables, they'd be just above
          <code>Num</code>, such that we could access them by a simple indexing
          operation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the generated assembly, there's also a line
          <code>mov [rbp-8], r10</code>. This just spills that frame pointer to
          the stack in case we need to modify the <code>r10</code> register
          (such as if we need to call a nested function that's in a wider
          scope).
        </p>

        <p>
          The generated assembly for the <code>Id</code> function itself is
          slightly more complicated. It needs to put the <code>X</code>
          parameter on the stack (since it is passed by register in this
          calling convention), then create the appropriate frame pointer which
          it can pass to <code>Id.Inner</code> before it can actually call that
          function.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-t>id</h-t>:
        <h-k>push</h-k>    rbp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rbp, rsp
        <h-k>sub</h-k>     rsp, <h-l>32</h-l>           <h-c># allocate some stack space</h-c>
        <h-k>lea</h-k>     rax, [rbp+<h-l>16</h-l>]
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>8</h-l>], rax      <h-c># save the frame base parent</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>16</h-l>], edi     <h-c># spill 'Num' to the stack</h-c>
        <h-k>lea</h-k>     rax, [rbp-<h-l>16</h-l>]     <h-c># create the frame pointer</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     r10, rax
        <h-k>call</h-k>    <h-t>id__inner</h-t>
        <h-k>leave</h-k>
        <h-k>ret</h-k>
</pre>
        
        <p>
          The parameter <code>Num</code> is passed in the <code>edi</code>
          register. Note that we put the address <code>rbp+16</code> as a stack
          variable &ndash; this is the frame base parent (sometimes called a
          dynamic link) and is mostly useful for dynamically sized stack
          allocated variables<sup><a href="#note-2" id="ref-2a">2</a></sup>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Following that, we spill <code>Num</code> onto the stack, and create a
          pointer to that stack data. If we had more stack variables, we'd put
          them next to <code>Num</code> here. This leaves us with a stack that
          looks something like this just before the call:
        </p>

        <pre>
,---------------------, &lt;-- rsp
| Num                 |
|---------------------| &lt;-- r10  (frame pointer)
| (frame base parent) | --&gt;------+
|=====================| &lt;-- rbp  |
| prev. rbp           |          |
|---------------------|          |
| return pointer      |          |
|---------------------| &lt;--------+
| ...                 |
</pre>
        
        <p>
          With this setup, we have access to the outer variable <code>Num</code>
          from a nested function via the <code>r10</code> register. This matches
          the setup that <code>Inner</code> expects above, so everything
          works out nicely.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- linked lists ------------------------------------------------------->

      <section>
        <h2 id="linked-lists">Linked lists</h2>

        <p>
          The next problem we face is that of accessing variables that are more
          than one scope out. Consider a slightly modified version of the above
          example.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>function</h-k> Id (Num : <h-t>Integer</h-t>) <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k>
  <h-k>function</h-k> Inner <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k>
    <h-k>function</h-k> Extra_Inner <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k> (Num);
  <h-k>begin</h-k>
    <h-k>return</h-k> Extra_Inner;
  <h-k>end</h-k> Inner;
<h-k>begin</h-k>
  <h-k>return</h-k> Inner;
<h-k>end</h-k> Id;
</pre>
      
        <p>
          Now, <code>Inner</code> itself contains a nested function
          <code>Extra_Inner</code>, which references the <code>Num</code> two
          scopes up. As we saw, when we call a nested function, we build up a
          frame with the data and then send a pointer to that frame to the
          function. Now, <code>Inner</code> could copy the <code>Num</code> onto
          its own stack frame and take a pointer there, but if we change the
          example such that <code>Extra_Inner</code> modifies it instead of just
          returning it, we'll see that it has access to the variable itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of copying parameters onto its own stack, GNAT does something
          slightly more sophisticated. The idea is that we build up a linked
          list of stack frames, which we can then traverse the required number
          of times to find the necessary variable. Note that this linked list
          corresponds to the <em>static lexical scope</em> of the functions,
          <em>not</em> the dynamic scope. Even if we add recursion to
          <code>Inner</code>, that linked list stays the same length.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effectively, we want something like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
,---------------------------,
| (Extra_Inner stack frame) |
|===========================| &lt;== Extra_Inner
| (stack data)              |
|---------------------------|
| <strong>previous frame pointer</strong>    | --&gt;--------,
|---------------------------| &lt;-- r10    |
| (stack data)              |
|===========================| &lt;== Inner  |
| (stack data)              |            |
|---------------------------|            |
| <strong>Num</strong>                       |            |
|---------------------------| &lt;----------'
| (stack data)              |
|===========================| &lt;== Id
| ...                       |
</pre>

        <p>
          Now, <code>Extra_Inner</code> can find that outer <code>Num</code> by
          first dereferencing <code>r10</code> to get the frame of
          <code>Inner</code>, then finding the frame pointer and dereferencing
          <em>that</em>. We get a linked list of frames:
        </p>

        <pre>r10 -&gt; Inner frame -&gt; Id frame</pre>

        <p>
          If we look at the generated for <code>Extra_Inner</code>, we'll see it
          in action:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-t>id__inner__extra_inner</h-t>:
        <h-k>push</h-k>    rbp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rbp, rsp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>8</h-l>], r10    <h-c># save the frame</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rax, [r10]      <h-c># frame = frame[0]</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     eax, [rax]      <h-c># return frame-&gt;Num</h-c>
        <h-k>pop</h-k>     rbp
        <h-k>ret</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          As before, we spill the frame to the stack, and then traverse it twice
          to get <code>Num</code>. The body of <code>Inner</code> requires a bit
          more care now, since we expect that previous frame pointer to be
          stored at the frame pointer we are given in <code>r10</code>. To
          illustrate, let's check out what happens to <code>Extra_Inner</code>
          if we rewrite <code>Inner</code> like so: 
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>function</h-k> Id (Num : <h-t>Integer</h-t>) <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k>
  <h-k>function</h-k> Inner (Y : <h-t>Integer</h-t>) <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k>
    <h-k>function</h-k> Extra_Inner <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k> (Num + Y);
  <h-k>begin</h-k>
    <h-k>return</h-k> Extra_Inner;
  <h-k>end</h-k> Inner;
<h-k>begin</h-k>
  <h-k>return</h-k> Inner(<h-l>10</h-l>);
<h-k>end</h-k> Id;
</pre>

        <p>
          Now, <code>Extra_Inner</code> references variables from both its
          immediate outer scope (the <code>Y</code> from <code>Inner</code>'s
          frame) and the one outside there (the <code>Num</code> from
          <code>Id</code>'s frame). The generated assembly is a bit heavier,
          though that is largely due to overflow checking. The relevant section
          looks like this<sup><a href="#note-3" id="ref-3a">3</a></sup>:
        </p>

        <pre>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rdx, [r10]      <h-c># prev = frame[0]</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     edx, [rdx]      <h-c># num = prev[0]</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     eax, [r10+<h-l>8</h-l>]    <h-c># y = frame[8]</h-c>
        <h-k>add</h-k>     eax, edx
        <h-k>leave</h-k>
        <h-k>ret</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          As mentioned, <code>Inner</code> needs to do a bit more work to call
          <code>Extra_Inner</code>, since it needs to save the previous frame
          like a stack local, but it is largely similar to before:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-t>id__inner</h-t>:
        <h-k>push</h-k>    rbp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rbp, rsp
        <h-k>sub</h-k>     rsp, <h-l>48</h-l>         <h-c># allocate some stack space</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>48</h-l>], r10   <h-c># save the frame</h-c>
        <h-k>lea</h-k>     rax, [rbp+<h-l>16</h-l>]
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>16</h-l>], rax   <h-c># save the frame base parent</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>24</h-l>], edi   <h-c># frame[8] = y</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>32</h-l>], r10   <h-c># frame[0] = prev</h-c>
        <h-k>lea</h-k>     rax, [rbp-<h-l>32</h-l>]   <h-c># create a new frame pointer</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     r10, rax
        <h-k>call</h-k>    <h-t>id__inner__extra_inner</h-t>
        <h-k>leave</h-k>
        <h-k>ret</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          At this point, it might be obvious why we need to save the frame
          with <code>mov [rbp-48], r10</code>, since we overwrite it before we
          pass it to <code>Extra_Inner</code>. Also note that the code for the
          <code>Inner</code> without the <code>Y</code> parameter is largely the
          same, it just doesn't put anything but the previous frame pointer on
          the stack.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just before the call, the stack will look something like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
,--------------------,
| Y                  |
|--------------------|
| prev frame pointer | --&gt;--...
|--------------------| &lt;-- r10
| frame base parent  | --&gt;--...
|====================| &lt;== Inner
| ...                |
</pre>

        <p>
          Which is what <code>Extra_Inner</code> expects.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            Note that since the stack grows downwards on x86, things are sort of
            flipped but also not. In the actual code, the order of
            <code>Y</code> and the previous frame pointer is the same, but they
            will be below the frame base parent, not above.
          </em>

      <!-- function descriptors ----------------------------------------------->

      <section>
        <h2 id="descriptors">Function descriptors</h2>

        <p>
          The last piece of the puzzle is how we handle pointers to nested
          functions. There are many approaches one could take here
          (<a href="https://thephd.dev/lambdas-nested-functions-block-expressions-oh-my#executable-wha-">some worse than others</a>),
          including Rust-style monomorphisation. GNAT takes an approach which
          lets nested functions (and closures in general) be represented as
          single pointers.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is possible for one important reason: code is aligned on 16-byte
          boundaries. This means that the lowest few bits of a pointer to a
          function (or a function pointer, as you could call it) are always
          unset. GNAT exploits this by using the lowest bit as a function
          descriptor &ndash; if it is set, then the pointer isn't actually a
          function pointer, but a nested function pointer, which needs special
          treatment. If it is unset, it is a bog standard function pointer which
          for which we can do a simple <code>call</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main idea is that we create a structure on the stack which
          contains the actual function pointer as well as the frame pointer it
          expects. This is pretty similar to a typical closure structure, with
          the frame pointer being the data that's closed over. As such, function
          descriptors are a technique that can be used to compile arbitrary
          closures into a single function
          pointer<sup><a href="#note-4" id="ref-4a">4</a></sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's look at an example:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>function</h-k> Id (Num : <h-t>Integer</h-t>) <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k>
  <h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>F</h-t> <h-k>is not null access function return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t>;
  <h-k>function</h-k> Inner <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k> (Num);
  <h-k>function</h-k> Run (Func : <h-t>F</h-t>) <h-k>return</h-k> <h-t>Integer</h-t> <h-k>is</h-k> (Func.<h-k>all</h-k>);
<h-k>begin</h-k>
  <h-k>return</h-k> Run (Inner<h-l>'Access</h-l>);
<h-k>end</h-k> Id;
</pre>

        <p>
          <code>not null access function return Integer</code> is Ada's verbose
          way of saying &ldquo;non-null pointer to a function returning an
          integer&rdquo;, <code>Func.all</code> dereferences the function
          (and implicitly calls it, since it takes no arguments), and
          <code>Inner'Access</code> gets the pointer to the <code>Inner</code>
          function.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>Inner</code> is compiled just like before:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-t>id__inner</h-t>:
        <h-k>push</h-k>    rbp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rbp, rsp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>8</h-l>], r10    <h-c># save the frame</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     eax, [r10]      <h-c># return frame-&gt;Num</h-c>
        <h-k>pop</h-k>     rbp
        <h-k>ret</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          <code>Run</code> is a bit more involved. One thing to notice here is
          that although there is some special logic involved in calling the
          function pointer, this is not because of the particulars of the
          example program but because any function pointer could potentially be
          a pointer to a nested function.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-t>id__run</h-t>:
        <h-k>push</h-k>    rbp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rbp, rsp
        <h-k>sub</h-k>     rsp, <h-l>16</h-l>         <h-c># allocate some stack space</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>8</h-l>], rdi    <h-c># spill Func to the stack</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>16</h-l>], r10   <h-c># save the frame given to Run</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rax, rdi
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rdx, rax
        <h-k>and</h-k>     edx, 1
        <h-k>test</h-k>    rdx, rdx        <h-c># is the lowest bit set?</h-c>
        <h-k>je</h-k>      <h-t>.L7</h-t>             <h-c># jump to .L7 if not</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     r10, [rax-<h-l>1</h-l>]    <h-c># frame = Func[-1]</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rax, [rax+<h-l>7</h-l>]    <h-c># Func  = Func[7]</h-c>
<h-t>.L7</h-t>:
        <h-k>call</h-k>    rax             <h-c># call Func</h-c>
        <h-k>leave</h-k>
        <h-k>ret</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          In <code>Run</code>, we check if the lowest bit is set, and call the
          nested function appropriately if so. In that case, <code>Run</code>
          expects <code>Func</code> to point to a structure that looks like this
        </p>

        <pre>
,------------------, &lt;-- Func
| frame pointer    |
|------------------|
| function pointer |
'------------------'
</pre>

        <p>
          Which let's us access the frame pointer as <code>Func[0]</code> and
          the function pointer as <code>Func[8]</code>. However, since the
          lowest bit is set, the pointer we are given is actually
          <code>Func + 1</code>, which means the frame pointer is at the offset
          <code>-1</code> and the function pointer at <code>7</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, <code>Id</code> looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-t>id</h-t>:
        <h-k>push</h-k>    rbp
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rbp, rsp
        <h-k>sub</h-k>     rsp, <h-l>48</h-l>             <h-c># allocate some stack space</h-c>
        <h-k>lea</h-k>     rax, [rbp+<h-l>16</h-l>]
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>8</h-l>], rax        <h-c># save the frame base parent</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rbp-<h-l>32</h-l>], edi       <h-c># spill 'Num' to the stack</h-c>

        <h-c># create the frame pointer 'Inner' expects</h-c>
        <h-k>lea</h-k>     rax, [rbp-<h-l>32</h-l>]
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rdx, rax
        <h-k>add</h-k>     rax, <h-l>8</h-l>

        <h-c># create the nested function structure</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rax], rdx          <h-c># store the frame pointer</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     [rax+<h-l>8</h-l>], <h-t>id__inner</h-t>  <h-c># store the function pointer</h-c>

        <h-c># create the pointer to that structure</h-c>
        <h-k>lea</h-k>     rax, [rbp-<h-l>32</h-l>]
        <h-k>add</h-k>     rax, <h-l>8</h-l>              <h-c># point in-between frame &amp; function</h-c>
        <h-k>add</h-k>     rax, <h-l>1</h-l>              <h-c># set the lowest bit</h-c>

        <h-c># call 'Run'</h-c>
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     r10, rdx
        <h-k>mov</h-k>     rdi, rax
        <h-k>call</h-k>    <h-t>id__run</h-t>
        <h-k>leave</h-k>
        <h-k>ret</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          Things are a bit more convoluted, but the gist is that we store
          <code>Num</code> on the stack at <code>rbp-32</code>, to which the
          frame pointer points. Additionally, we create a closure-like structure
          containing the function pointer (at <code>rbp-16</code>) and the frame
          pointer (at <code>rbp-24</code>). Finally, the &ldquo;function
          pointer&rdquo; we pass to <code>Run</code> actually points to that
          structure, so we set its lowest bit such that we don't accidentally
          try to call the stack.
        </p>

        <p>
          That gives us this stack layout just before the call:
        </p>

        <pre>
,------------------,
| function pointer |
|------------------|
| frame pointer    | --&gt;------+
|------------------| &lt;-- rdi  |
| Num              |          |
|------------------| &lt;-- r10 -+
| ...              |
</pre>

        <p>
          Of course, <code>rdi</code> is off by its lowest bit, and there's a
          frame base parent and other things that complicate this picture, but
          this is the general idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both <code>r10</code> and the frame pointer <code>Inner</code> expects
          point to <code>Num</code>. This is because <code>Run</code> is also a
          nested function which happens to require the same frame pointer as
          <code>Inner</code>, since they're declared in the same scope.

      <!-- why does this work? ------------------------------------------------>

      <section>
        <h2 id="why">Why does this work?</h2>

        <p>
          All of this relies on two things being true:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Nested functions are inaccessible from the outside</li>
          <li>Pointers to nested functions cannot escape their scope</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This is perhaps the major difference between nested functions and
          closures, with the former largely being a special case of the latter.
          As long as both the points above hold, however, a nested function
          doesn't actually need to capture the specific outer variables it uses,
          since it can access them by reference via the stack frames. And
          because nested functions are stuck within their scope, that protects
          against use-after-frees.
        </p>

        <p>
          One could take the C approach to these problems and call it undefined
          behaviour if a nested function was used outside its scope, but GNAT is
          in fact able to prevent it from happening entirely at compiler
          time<sup><a href="#note-5" id="ref-5a">5</a></sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The way in which GNAT and Ada in general is able to do this is by
          firstly limiting nested function pointers to only be assignable to
          pointer types declared in their scope or a child one. This means that
          this is legal:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>procedure</h-k> Outer <h-k>is</h-k>
  <h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>P</h-t> <h-k>is access procedure</h-k>;
  <h-k>procedure</h-k> Inner <h-k>is</h-k>
  <h-k>begin</h-k>
    <h-k>null</h-k>;
  <h-k>end</h-k> Inner;

  Ptr : <h-t>P</h-t> := Inner<h-l>'Access</h-l>;
<h-k>begin</h-k>
  <h-k>null</h-k>;
<h-k>end</h-k> Outer;
</pre>

        <p>
          while this is not:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>P</h-t> <h-k>is access procedure</h-k>;
<h-k>procedure</h-k> Outer <h-k>is</h-k>
  <h-k>procedure</h-k> Inner <h-k>is</h-k>
  <h-k>begin</h-k>
    <h-k>null</h-k>;
  <h-k>end</h-k> Inner;

  Ptr : <h-t>P</h-t> := Inner<h-l>'Access</h-l>;
<h-k>begin</h-k>
  <h-k>null</h-k>;
<h-k>end</h-k> Outer;
</pre>
        
        <p>
          Since all functions and such must have their types fully annotated,
          and a type specified within a function is inaccessible outside, a
          pointer to a nested function cannot escape that way. It does also mean
          that a higher-order function declared outside a given scope cannot
          accept nested functions from within the scope as long as the function
          type they expect is named.
        </p>

        <p>
          Things get a bit more hairy with anonymous access types. Functions
          taking such types <em>can</em> take nested functions from narrower
          scopes as arguments. In this case, GNAT just disallows any assignments
          or attempts to convert such function pointer types to a named one,
          which prevents storing them.

            implemented in GNAT, since they're expanded in this redundant
            fashion even before the code is lowered to GIMPLE. Presumably, the
