        <h2>1. Classes</h2>

        <p>
          A class is a reified environment with a set of functions that may
          access that environment. In simpler terms, objects are bundles of data
          with methods that may both access and change that data. The term
          <code>class</code> was chosen partially because this is very similar
          to object-oriented classes, although without inheritance, subtyping
          and dynamic dispatch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Classes are described by <code>trait</code>s, which expose the set of
          operations outside code may use. Traits can be automatically derived
          from a class definition.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>let</h-k> person = <h-k>fun</h-k> (name', age') <h-k>class</h-k>
  <h-k>var</h-k> name: <h-t>String</h-t> = name'
  <h-k>var</h-k> age: <h-t>Nat</h-t> = age'

  <h-k>fun</h-k> rename(to) <h-k>use</h-k> (<h-k>var</h-k> name)
    <h-k>set</h-k> name = to
  <h-k>end</h-k>

  <h-k>fun</h-k> olden(by) <h-k>use</h-k> (<h-k>var</h-k> age)

</pre>
        
        <p>
          Fields or methods can be hidden from outside code by not making it
          part of the type signature, or by using <code>private</code> in a
          class definition (which does the same for the inferred trait).
        </p>

</pre>

        <p>
          The data assosciated with a class can be any item, including types and
          other classes. This means that the class system also doubles as a
          module system, where a module is just a constant class. Because of
          this doubling, ML-style functors and parameterized classes come for
          free.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides this, classes can also serve as a base upon which closures,
          records, and other kinds of features can be built.

      <!-- effects ------------------------------------------------------------>

      <section id="effects">
        <h2>2. Effects</h2>

        <p>
          Effects are a mechanism for enforcing certain dynamic properties about
          a program, as well as for implementing advanced control flow
          constructs and lightweight dependency injection/context management.
        </p>

        <p>
          An effect is a type consisting of a set of function- and value
          signatures. Code may call these functions like any other function, and
          other code may implement these functions using effect handlers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effect handlers are dynamically scoped. Calling an effect function
          (aka performing it) has the semantics of traversing the call stack
          until a suitable handler is found, and executing that. This means that
          effects can be used to implement an exception-like mechanism:
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>Except</h-t>(<h-t>T</h-t>) = <h-k>eff</h-k>
  <h-k>fun</h-k> throw(value: <h-t>T</h-t>): <h-t>Never</h-t>
<h-k>end</h-k>

<h-k>fun</h-k> div(a, b: <h-t>Int</h-t>): <h-t>Int</h-t>
  <h-k>if</h-k> b = <h-l>0</h-l>
    <h-k>do</h-k> throw(<h-l>"division by zero!"</h-l> <h-k>as</h-k> <h-t>String</h-t>)
  <h-k>end</h-k>

  <h-k>return</h-k> a / b
<h-k>end</h-k>
</pre>
        <p>
          If no effect handler is found in the call stack, then a default
          handler must be present. This is executed if the effect &lduqo;passes
          through&rdquo; <code>main</code>.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>default</h-k> = <h-k>impl</h-k> <h-t>Except</h-t>(<h-t>String</h-t>)
  <h-k>fun</h-k> throw(msg)
    <h-k>do</h-k> eprintln(msg)
    <h-k>do</h-k> exit(1)
  <h-k>end</h-k>
<h-k>end</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          Effects are also able to resume, which returns execution back to where
          the effect function was initially called. This works like a normal
          return, and can provide a value.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>type</h-k> <h-t>Get</h-t> = <h-k>eff</h-k>
  <h-k>fun</h-k> get: <h-t>Int</h-t>
<h-k>end</h-k>

<h-k>fun</h-k> add(x) =&gt; x + get()

<h-k>default</h-k> = <h-k>impl</h-k> <h-t>Get</h-t>
  <h-k>fun</h-k> get =&gt; 5
<h-k>end</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          Effect handlers are first class values, and can be passed around and
          dynamically selected. Using <code>with</code> blocks, these handlers
          can be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          Effect handlers are able to perform more complex operations by being
          more careful in how they resume. In an effect handler, the
          <code>return x</code> construct is a shorthand for writing
          <code>break (continue x)</code>. <code>continue</code> represents a
          function that resumes when called, while <code>break</code> represents
          a function that provides a value to the <code>with</code>-block where
          the handler is used.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means that a handler may resume multiple times, which looks like
          the program executing a certain portion of the code multiple times, or
          it may choose to not resume at all.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>let</h-k> nothing = <h-k>impl</h-k> <h-t>Get</h-t>
  <h-k>fun</h-k> get
    <h-k>break</h-k> ()
  <h-k>end</h-k>
<h-k>end</h-k>

<h-k>let</h-k> zero = <h-k>impl</h-k> <h-t>Get</h-t>
  <h-k>fun</h-k> get
    <h-k>continue</h-k> <h-l>0</h-l>
    <h-k>break</h-k> ()
  <h-k>end</h-k>
<h-k>end</h-k>

<h-k>fun</h-k> many(vals: [<h-t>Int</h-t>]) =&gt; <h-k>impl</h-k> <h-t>Get</h-t>
  <h-k>fun</h-k> get
    <h-k>for</h-k> v <h-k>in</h-k> vals
      <h-k>continue</h-k> v
    <h-k>end</h-k>

    <h-k>break</h-k> ()
  <h-k>end</h-k>
<h-k>end</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          Effects as such provide a very powerful mechanism for implementing
          many kinds of control flow constructs, like exceptions, generators,
          async/await, and non-deterministic constructs like <code>select</code>
          (which is a slightly more generic version of <code>many</code> above).
        </p>

        <p>
          Effects are statically typed. Any function that calls
          <code>get</code>, for instance, acquires the effect <code>Get</code>
          as part of its signature. The same goes for any function that calls
          <em>that</em> function again. The only way to stop this propagation of
          effects is by providing a handler. Effect types that propagate onto
          <code>main</code> must have a default handler.
        </p>

        <p>
          The static typing enables certain powerful mechanisms. For one, only
          pure code (i.e. code that handles all its effects) may be used in
          constant contexts. This supersedes the need for any
          <code>const fn</code> limitations, since it can instead be ensured by
          the type system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly, any pure code can be fully executed at compile time without
          issue (since it must be deterministic). This begets a powerful (and
          potentially slow) whole-program partial evaluation, where pretty much
          anything that's constant can be reduced to that constant form at
          compile time.
        </p>

        <p>
          To ensure determinism in pure code, foreign calls are only possible to
          make within a default handler. This means that all potential sources
          of non-determinism will either be made deterministic by other
          deterministic handlers, or will propagate through all calling code to
          signify their non-determinism.
