          Some rough ideas for a tiered system of concurrency in Z. No syntax,
          definite semantics or pretty much anything here represents a genuine
          design proposal. Instead, this sketches out an idea motivated by the
          observation that concurrency typically comes in a few, distinct
          fashions, and that using a single primitive (like fire-and-forget
          threading) is less than ideal.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are three &ldquo;tiers&rdquo; of concurrency &ndash; actors,
          tasks and local parallelism. Local parallelism consists of
          iterators that have been parallelised and parallel blocks.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>fun</h-k> main()
  <h-k>let</h-k> cubes =
    <h-k>parallel for</h-k> i <h-k>in</h-k> <h-l>0</h-l> <h-k>upto</h-k> <h-l>5</h-l> =&gt; i ** <h-l>3</h-l>
  println(cubes)
<h-k>end</h-k>

<h-k>fun</h-k> traverse (self : <h-t>Tree</h-t>)
  <h-k>case</h-k> self
    <h-k>is</h-k> binary(<h-k>let</h-k> left, <h-k>let</h-k> right)
      <h-k>parallel</h-k>
        <h-k>do</h-k> left.traverse()
      <h-k>and</h-k>
        <h-k>do</h-k> right.traverse()
      <h-k>and</h-k>
        <h-k>do</h-k> println(self.data)
      <h-k>end</h-k>
    <h-k>else</h-k>
      <h-k>null</h-k>
    <h-k>end</h-k>
  <h-k>end case</h-k>
<h-k>end</h-k> traverse
</pre>
        
        <p>
          The <code>parallel</code> keyword instructs the language to optionally
          perform whatever code it encompasses in parallel if possible. This is
          meant to be a lightweight operation, and the compiler may choose to
          emit sequential code (though with no restrictions on ordering).
        </p>

        <p>
          Tasks are more slightly more heavyweight, akin to either
          runtime-scheduled, OS-scheduled or M:N scheduled threads. Tasks may be
          declared within a function-like scope, and such a scope will only
          return once all its contained tasks have terminated.
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>fun</h-k> main
  storage.store(5)
  println(storage.fetch())
<h-k>where</h-k>
  <h-k>type</h-k> Storage = <h-k>task</h-k>
    <h-k>fun</h-k> store(x: <h-t>Int</h-t>)
    <h-k>fun</h-k> fetch: <h-t>Int</h-t>
  <h-k>end</h-k>

  <h-k>let</h-k> storage: Storage = <h-k>task</h-k>
    <h-k>let</h-k> value
    <h-k>accept</h-k> store(x)
      value = x
    <h-k>end</h-k> store

    <h-k>accept</h-k> fetch
      <h-k>return</h-k> value
    <h-k>end</h-k> fetch
  <h-k>end task</h-k>
<h-k>end</h-k> main
        </pre>

        <p>
          Tasks are ran concurrently, potentially with a mechanism for
          data-sharing/synchronization similar to
          <a href="01-wwad-concurrency.html">Ada's entries</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, actors are isolated processes/system threads to which
          messages can be sent in an asynchronous, non-blocking manner and which
          handle those messages in a single-threaded fashion (unless some other
          concurrency primitive is used).
        </p>

        <pre>
<h-k>actor</h-k> Counter
  <h-k>fun</h-k> inc(by: <h-t>Int</h-t>)
    <h-k>set</h-k> value += by
  <h-k>end</h-k>

  <h-k>fun</h-k> display
    <h-k>do</h-k> println(value)
  <h-k>end</h-k>
<h-k>private</h-k>
  <h-k>var</h-k> value: <h-t>Int</h-t> = <h-l>0</h-l>
<h-k>end</h-k>

<h-k>fun</h-k> main
  <h-k>do</h-k> Counter.inc(<h-l>5</h-l>)
  <h-k>do</h-k> Counter.display()
<h-k>end</h-k>
</pre>

        <p>
          Local parallelism is useful for spawning array computations or for
          easily doing calculations in parallel. Tasks are more suitable for
          situations where a semi-cooperative mode of concurrency is
          appropriate, and where a procedure needs to do several things in some
          unspecified order. Finally, actors are suitable for long-running
          background tasks which don't need to be updated synchronously with the
          rest of the program, like databases, UI threads or language servers.
