        The word &ldquo;portability&rdquo; is used to mean two subtly different
        things. People who say C is portable mean that the
        <em>language itself</em> is portable &ndash; if the platform can execute
        code, there is probably a C compiler for it. People who say Java, Python
        or Rust are portable mean that <em>code written in these languages</em>
        is easily portable &ndash; even large, complex codebases can just be
        copied over to another platform and compiled without trouble. Making
        platform-specific programs is opt-in.
      </p>

      <p>
        C-style portability is nice because making software for bespoke
        platforms only requires knowledge of C. Java-style portability is nice
        because you can write code that works (and maybe even looks) the same
        for all of your users. Neither imply the other.
