      <!-- intro -------------------------------------------------------------->

      <main>
        <p>
          In the most basic sense, most kinds of types in various programming
          languages can be constructed by <em>composing</em> several simpler
          types together. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The name <strong>algebraic data types</strong> comes from the
          realization that some kinds of compositions of types can be used to
          create algebraic structures. The term itself often refers specifically
          to sum types (and sometimes also product types).
        </p>

        <!-- sum types -------------------------------------------------------->

        <section>
          <h2 id="sum-types">Sum types</h2>

          <p>
            A sum type, usually written $T+U$ for some types $T$Â and $U$, is a
            type whose values are <em>either</em> of type $T$ or of type $U$.
            Sum types can also be called disjoint unions, tagged unions, variant
            types, or occasionally enum types.
          </p>

          <p>
            In most languages, sum types are created with type definitions. As
            an example, the equivalent of the $+$ type constructor looks like
            the following in Haskell and Rust:
          </p>

          <pre>
<h-k>data</h-k> <h-t>Either a b</h-t> = <h-l>Left</h-l> <h-t>a</h-t>
                | <h-l>Right</h-l> <h-t>b</h-t>
</pre>

          <pre>
<h-k>enum</h-k> <h-t>Either</h-t>&lt;<h-t>T</h-t>, <h-t>U</h-t>&gt; {
    <h-l>Left</h-l>(<h-t>T</h-t>),
    <h-l>Right</h-l>(<h-t>U</h-t>),
}
</pre>

          <p>
            The type <code>Bool</code> has two values while a type
            <code>Unit</code> has one value. The type <code>Bool + Unit</code>
            then has $2+1=3$ values; the number of values in a sum type is the
            sum of the number of values of its constituent parts.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a sense, the <code>Either</code> type is the only sum type you
            need - all others can be represented as just nested
            <code>Either</code>, which is why more formal type theory models
            typically only include the $T+U$ way of forming sum types. In fact,
            it turns out that sums are <em>associative up to isomorphism</em>,
            which means that the types $(T + U) + V$ and $T + (U + V)$ can be
            freely converted between each other without any loss of information.
            The same goes for commutativity; although $T+U$ and $U+T$ are
            distinct types, a value of one can easily be turned into a value of
            the other without losing information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that a sum type is different from a union type; although a
            union like <code>Int or Int</code> is the same as just
            <code>Int</code>, the sum type <code>Int + Int</code> is not.
            Concretely, the latter contains one more bit of information (whether
            or not the value is of the &ldquo;left&rdquo; or the
            &rdquo;right&rdquo; <code>Int</code>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- product types ---------------------------------------------------->

        <section>
          <h2 id="product-types">Product types</h2>

          <p>
            A product type, usually written $T\cdot U$, $T*U$, or $T\times U$,
            is a type whose values contain <em>both</em> a value of type $T$ and
            a value of type $U$. Product types can also be called records,
            structs, or codata types. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Like sum types, product types can all be represented with the type
            constructor $\times$, since product types are also associative and
            commutative up to isomorphism.
          </p>

          <pre>
<h-k>data</h-k> <h-t>Both a b</h-t> = <h-l>Both</h-l> <h-t>a b</h-t>
</pre>

          <pre>
<h-k>enum</h-k> <h-t>Both</h-t>&lt;<h-t>T</h-t>, <h-t>U</h-t>&gt; {
    <h-l>Both</h-l>(<h-t>T</h-t>, <h-t>U</h-t>),
}

<h-c>// or more idiomatically</h-c>

<h-k>struct</h-k> <h-t>Both</h-t>&lt;<h-t>T</h-t>, <h-t>U</h-t>&gt;(<h-t>T</h-t>, <h-t>U</h-t>);
</pre>

          <p>
            Product types are similar to cartesian products. The number of
            elements in a product type like <code>Bool * Int</code> is the
            number of elements in a <code>Bool</code> times the number of
            elements in an <code>Int</code>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- identities ------------------------------------------------------->

        <section>
          <h2 id="identities">Identities</h2>

          <p>
            Certain types are <em>identity types</em> with respect to these type
            constructor, in the sense that combining any other type with these
            adds no extra information to the overall type.
          </p>

          <p>
            For product types, the identity is the <code>Unit</code> type
            &ndash; also known as $1$ or <code>Void</code> &ndash; which has one
            element (often <code>()</code>), and since one is identity element
            for multiplication, doing $T\times 1$ adds no extra information. In
            particular, given a value $t:T$, we only have one way of
            constructing a value $T\times 1$, namely $(t, ())$.
          </p>

          <p>
            For sum types, the identity is the <code>Never</code> type &ndash;
            also known as $0$, <code>Bottom</code> or confusingly,
            <code>Void</code> &ndash; which has no elements. This means that it
            is impossible to construct a value which has that type, which
            further means that the only way to construct a value of type $T+0$
            given some value $t:T$ is $\mathrm{Left}\;t$.
          </p>

          <p>
            The bottom type is similar to $0$ in that a product type $T\times 0$
            is itself not possible to construct. All of this may seem uncannily
            close to how natural numbers work: addition and multiplication are
            associative and commutative operations, adding zero or multiplying
            by one does nothing, and multiplying by zero gives zero. In fact,
            sums and products for both the natural numbers and for types with
            units and bottom types form a so-called
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring">semiring</a>, which
            is a kind of algebraic structure &ndash; hence the
            <em>algebraic</em>.
