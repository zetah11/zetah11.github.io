          You'll be presented with a list of hidden words, each of which is a
          keyword in the language you choose. As you type out words, those
          which appear on the list will be revealed. By default, the words will
          be placed in a random order. Check &ldquo;Alphabetical order&rdquo;
          to instead order them.
        </p>

        <p>
          For languages where keywords are case insensitive, the game will also
          be case insensitive.

          What exactly is a keyword? The answer depends on the language and is
          often quite fuzzy. In some languages, whether a word is classified as
          a keyword or not can depend on all kinds of context and which
          specific implementation you're using. For the purposes of this quiz,
          an &ldquo;include as many as is reasonable&rdquo;-approach is taken:
          if it looks a bit like an identifier or name, but the language
          gives it some special meaning or syntax, it's a keyword.
